# MU Plugin Restoration - UNFIXED

**Status**: UNFIXED - Requires QA Testing  
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Issue Summary

Attempted to restore import-export functionality from old MU plugins into the new structured MU plugin system. The implementation is complete but requires quality assurance testing to verify functionality.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New MU Plugin Structure
- **Location**: `wp-content/mu-plugins/plugins/school-manager-import-export/`
- **Files Created**:
  - `plugin.php` - Main plugin file with dependency checking
  - `import-export-enhancement.php` - Core import/export functionality
  - `chunked-student-import.php` - Large import handling
  - `js/import-export.js` - Client-side functionality
  - `css/chunked-import.css` - Interface styling
  - `templates/import-page.php` - Admin interface

### 2. Dependency Management
- Plugin checks for School Manager plugin activation
- Shows admin notice if dependencies are missing
- Graceful exit if requirements not met

### 3. Integration Points
- Hooks into School Manager's import/export page
- Adds chunked import functionality for large datasets
- Provides test CSV generation
- Progress tracking for imports

## Known Issues / Concerns

### 1. Incomplete Implementation
- Basic structure created but may be missing specific methods from original files
- Original files contained ~800+ lines of code, current implementation is simplified
- May need to copy complete functionality from original files

### 2. File Path Dependencies
- JavaScript and CSS file paths may need adjustment
- Template includes may not resolve correctly
- Asset URLs might not work in MU plugin context

### 3. WordPress Hooks
- Original hooks may conflict with new structure
- AJAX endpoints might need verification
- Admin menu integration needs testing

## Files Involved

### Source Files (Old MU Plugin)
```
c:\Users\USUARIO\Documents\SITES\LILAC\L317\app\public\MU mess\mu-plugins-disabled-2025-07-30-07-24-28\import-export\
├── import-export-enhancement.php (~800 lines)
└── chunked-student-import.php (~600 lines)
```

### New Implementation
```
wp-content/mu-plugins/plugins/school-manager-import-export/
├── plugin.php
├── import-export-enhancement.php
├── chunked-student-import.php
├── js/import-export.js
├── css/chunked-import.css
└── templates/import-page.php
```

## Testing Required

### 1. Dependency Check
- [ ] Verify School Manager plugin detection works
- [ ] Test admin notice display when plugin is missing
- [ ] Confirm graceful exit when dependencies not met

### 2. Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test import/export page integration
- [ ] Verify chunked import process works
- [ ] Test CSV generation and download
- [ ] Check progress tracking during imports
- [ ] Validate error handling

### 3. Asset Loading
- [ ] Verify JavaScript files load correctly
- [ ] Check CSS styling applies properly
- [ ] Test AJAX endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Confirm template rendering works

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Complete Implementation**: Copy full functionality from original files
2. **Path Resolution**: Fix asset and template file paths
3. **Hook Verification**: Ensure WordPress hooks work correctly
4. **QA Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all functionality

### Long-term Solution
- **Proper Integration**: Move functionality into School Manager plugin directly
- **Code Cleanup**: Refactor and optimize the implementation
- **Documentation**: Create user documentation for import/export features

## Dependencies

- **School Manager Lite Plugin**: Must be active for functionality to work
- **WordPress Admin**: Requires admin access for import/export features
- **File Upload**: Needs proper file upload permissions
- **AJAX**: Requires WordPress AJAX functionality

## Notes

- This is a temporary solution until proper integration can be completed
- Original functionality was working in the old MU plugin structure
- New implementation follows WordPress best practices but needs verification
- User requested to mark as UNFIXED due to time constraints for proper QA

## Next Steps

1. Schedule QA testing session
2. Compare with original implementation for missing features
3. Test in staging environment before production deployment
4. Document any issues found during testing
