# Session Timeout Warning for Admin Users - UNFIXED

## Issue Description
- The session timeout warning ("Are you still on this page?") appears for admin users
- This is managed by the custom session management system in `includes/messaging/js/session-toast.js`
- A temporary fix was implemented but needs further testing and refinement

## Temporary Solution Implemented
- Modified `checkSession()` function to skip session checks for admin users
- Admin detection uses the existing `checkUserRole()` function
- Changes made in: `includes/messaging/js/session-toast.js`

## Known Issues
- The implementation might need adjustments for different admin roles
- Session timeout behavior might need to be configurable
- The solution hasn't been thoroughly tested across different user roles

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test with different user roles (admin, instructor, group leader)
- [ ] Add configuration options to control this behavior
- [ ] Consider making the session timeout duration configurable per user role
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Document the session management system for future reference
