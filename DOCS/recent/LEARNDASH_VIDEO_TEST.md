# LearnDash Video Integration Test Guide

## What We've Implemented

### ✅ Proper LD30 Template Integration
Instead of using mu-plugin workarounds, we've created the **correct solution** using LD30 template overrides:

1. **Custom LD30 Templates Created:**
   - `/themes/hello-elementor/learndash/ld30/lesson.php`
   - `/themes/hello-elementor/learndash/ld30/topic.php`

2. **Video Integration Plugin:**
   - `/mu-plugins/learndash-video-integration.php`

## How It Works

### The Correct Flow:
1. **LearnDash Core Processing**: Video content is processed by `Learndash_Course_Video::add_video_to_content()` in `class-ld-cpt-instance.php`
2. **Template Loading**: Your custom LD30 template receives the `$content` variable with video already included
3. **Display**: The template uses `learndash_get_template_part('modules/tabs.php')` to display content properly
4. **Assets**: Video CSS/JS are automatically enqueued when needed

### Key Difference from Previous Approach:
- ❌ **Old Way**: Bypass LearnDash system with mu-plugin content filters
- ✅ **New Way**: Work WITH LearnDash's native video processing system

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Add Video to a Lesson
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Lessons
2. Edit any lesson
3. Scroll to "Video" section
4. Add a YouTube URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
5. Enable video settings:
   - ✅ Auto Start (optional)
   - ✅ Show Controls
   - ✅ Video Focus Pause
   - ✅ Video Progression

### Step 2: View the Lesson
1. Go to the lesson on the frontend
2. **Expected Result**: Video should display in the content area
3. **Video Features Should Work**:
   - Video progression tracking
   - Resume from where you left off
   - Completion tracking

### Step 3: Check Debug Info (if WP_DEBUG is enabled)
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "LearnDash Video Integration Debug" log group
3. Should show:
   - Post ID and type
   - Video URL detected
   - Video class available
   - Video elements found in DOM

## Troubleshooting

### Video Not Showing?

**Check 1: Template Loading**
- Verify templates exist at `/themes/hello-elementor/learndash/ld30/`
- Check that LearnDash is using LD30 theme (not Legacy)

**Check 2: Video Settings**
- Ensure video URL is added in lesson settings
- Check that `LEARNDASH_LESSON_VIDEO` constant is true

**Check 3: Debug Information**
- Enable `WP_DEBUG` in wp-config.php
- Check browser console for debug info
- Check debug.log for error messages

### Video Shows But No Progression?

**Check 1: JavaScript Assets**
- Verify `learndash_video_script.js` is loaded
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Check 2: Video Settings**
- Ensure "Video Progression" is enabled in lesson settings
- Check that user is enrolled in the course

## File Locations

```
/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor/learndash/ld30/
├── lesson.php          # Custom lesson template
└── topic.php           # Custom topic template

/wp-content/mu-plugins/
└── learndash-video-integration.php  # Video support plugin
```

## Template Customization

The templates are fully customizable. Key sections:

### Video Content Display
```php
// This displays content with video already processed
learndash_get_template_part(
    'modules/tabs.php',
    array(
        'content' => $content, // Video is already here!
        'materials' => $materials,
        'context' => 'lesson',
    ),
    true
);
```

### Custom Styling
Both templates include responsive CSS for:
- Video container styling
- Mobile responsiveness
- RTL support for Hebrew content
- Professional appearance

## Expected Results

✅ **Videos display properly in lessons and topics**
✅ **Video progression tracking works**
✅ **Resume functionality works**
✅ **All LearnDash video settings respected**
✅ **Responsive design on mobile**
✅ **RTL support for Hebrew content**
✅ **Professional styling**

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** with a lesson that has a video
2. **Customize the templates** to match your design requirements
3. **Remove old mu-plugin files** if they're no longer needed:
   - `learndash-video-support.php`
   - `learndash-video-template-functions.php`

This approach is **future-proof** and works with LearnDash's core functionality rather than against it.
