# Login Redirection Update

**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Author**: System Update  
**Affected Version**: All  

## Overview

Updated the login redirection logic to prioritize LearnDash course access after login. Users will now be redirected to their enrolled LearnDash courses if available, with fallbacks to role-specific dashboards.

## Affected Files

1. `app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-theme-child-master/src/Login/LoginManager.php`
   - Method: `get_redirect_url()` (Lines ~200-250)
   - Method: `custom_login_redirect()` (Lines ~250-260)

## Changes Made

### 1. LearnDash Course Redirection
- Added logic to check for enrolled LearnDash courses
- If courses exist, redirects to the course with the lowest ID
- Falls back to existing role-based redirection if no courses found

### 2. Fallback Logic
- Maintains all existing role-based redirects
- Preserves WooCommerce and other plugin compatibility
- Handles edge cases gracefully

## Technical Details

### Key Functions
1. `get_redirect_url($user)`
   - Main function handling the redirection logic
   - First checks for LearnDash courses
   - Falls back to role-based redirects

2. `custom_login_redirect($redirect_to, $requested_redirect_to, $user)`
   - WordPress filter hook implementation
   - Handles the actual redirection after login

### Dependencies
- LearnDash LMS plugin
- WordPress core authentication system

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test User with Single Course**
   - Log in as a user with exactly one enrolled course
   - Should be redirected to that course

2. **Test User with Multiple Courses**
   - Log in as a user with multiple enrolled courses
   - Should be redirected to the course with the lowest ID

3. **Test User with No Courses**
   - Log in as a user with no enrolled courses
   - Should be redirected according to their role
   - Students: /my-courses/ or configured dashboard
   - Teachers: Admin dashboard
   - Admins: WordPress admin

4. **Test with LearnDash Deactivated**
   - Deactivate LearnDash
   - Verify fallback to role-based redirects works

## Rollback Plan

To revert these changes:
1. Restore the previous version of `LoginManager.php`
2. Clear any caching plugins
3. Test login redirections

## Notes
- The change is backward compatible
- No database changes were required
- Caching plugins may need to be cleared after deployment
